### Supported Versions

I will actively try to maintains and supports the **latest stable release** of the filter list available in the `main` branch as long as i could.

You can expect a response within **72 hours** confirming receipt of your report. I will then work to triage the issue and provide a timeline for a fix. I will try my best to keep you informed of the progress.
