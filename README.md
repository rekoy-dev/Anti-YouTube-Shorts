## 🛠️ Installation

You can install the **Anti-YouTube Shorts** filter list using one of these two simple methods:

### Method 1: Copy-Paste (Recommended)

This method is the fastest way to start blocking shorts immediately:

1.  Open the `Anti-YouTube Shorts.txt` file and **copy all** the text inside.
2.  Open your uBlock Origin or uBlock Origin Lite dashboard and go to the **"My Filters"** tab.
3.  Paste the copied text into the large filter box.
4.  Click **"Apply changes."**
5.  Refresh your YouTube web page or Hard Refresh your Browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
6.  Enjoyyyy!

### Method 2: 

If you use the **full version of uBlock Origin** (not Lite), you can subscribe to the list so it updates automatically when I make fixes (Maybe in the future?).

1.  Find the **Raw URL** for the `Anti-YouTube Shorts.txt` file on GitHub and **copy the URL**.
2.  Open your uBlock Origin dashboard and go to the **"Filter lists"** tab.
3.  Scroll to the very bottom and check the box next to **"Import..."**
4.  Paste the Raw URL into the box that appears.
5.  Click **"Apply changes."** uBlock will now handle updates for you!
